Week 2: 
Chapter 1 review questions: 
1) Explain what is meant by the economic problem.
	- An economical problem is when all our wants can't be satisfied - due to having unlimited wants but limited resources -  we are forced to choose our wants / needs carefully. 

2) Outline why economics can be described as a study of choices.
	- Economics examines how individuals, businesses, and governments share and allocate the limited resources responsibly to meet our unlimited needs and wants. 

3) Define opportunity cost.
	- Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that you give up when making a decision, highlighting the trade-offs between the choices you make and the options you had the chance to have/do. 

4) Explain how a production possibility frontier can be used to demonstrate the concept of opportunity cost.
	- It can show the opportunity cost by projecting the trade-off between the two goods or services. As we move along the curve, it highlights the cost of choosing one good over another, as producing more of one, results in losing out on the other. 

5) Identify why it is impossible for an economy to produce outside its production possibility frontier.
	- An economy can't produce outside its PPF because it  shows the most we can make with the resources we have, and anything beyond that would need more resources or better technology than what's available.

6) Discuss the circumstances under which it would be possible for the production possibility frontier to shift outward.
	- The production possibility frontier (PPF) can shift outward if an economy gains more resources, improves technology

7) Explain why we might find our economy producing at a level within (or below) the production possibility frontier.
	- An economy might produce at a level within or below the PPF because of inefficient use of resources, such as underemployment or misallocation which may prevent it from reaching its maximum output. 

8) Given the following production possibility schedule, construct a production
possibility frontier and answer the following questions.

	a -  What is the opportunity cost of obtaining the Ô¨Årst 30 units of tea?:
		50 beef 
	
	b - What is the opportunity cost of obtaining one unit of tea?:
		50(beef) / 30(tea) = 1.67 
			- therell be 1.67 units of beef per tea being produced 

9) Identify the kinds of opportunity costs that the government might face in attempting to satisfy community wants.
	a) Allocating resources between healthcare, education, and infrastructure
	b) Choosing between short-term economic stimulus and long-term investments.
	c) Balancing social welfare programs with economic growth policies
